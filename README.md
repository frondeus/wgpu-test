# WGPU test
This is my test field for wGPU technology.

I focused mainly on RayMarching although it means most of the logic is handled by fragment shader in GLSL not in Rust.

It was suprisingly easy to create an app and setup the pipeline.

While it is more verbose than OpenGL (keep in mind my knowledge about OGL is from around 2015) it still feels quite easy and definitely easier than Vulkan ;) 

Keyboard:
WSAD / Arrow keys = rotate camera
Space - go forward
Shift - go backwards

## Todo list:
* [ ] Mouse support
* [ ] Finish basic scene with nice night sky
* [ ] Focus a bit on a performance
